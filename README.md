# Brief Intro to MIC and WebGME
This repo is a WebGME example used for a talk at NashJS. The slides can be found at http://slides.com/brianbroll/deck-6

## Getting Started
Before you install this project, you must first install MongoDB and run an instance on your local machine. I will assume that it is running on the default machine.

Next, install the webgme-setup-tool and clone the repo:

```
npm install -g webgme-setup-tool
git clone https://github.com/brollb/NashJS-no-hands
```

Then, start the server:

```
cd NashJS-no-hands
webgme start
```

Now, you can navigate to `http://localhost:8888` and use this WebGME app!
